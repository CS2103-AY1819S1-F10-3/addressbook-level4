== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: Auto-matching
** *What it does:* Automatically finds vendors that can fulfill the service requirements of a specific client.
Inversely, it can also find all clients for which a specific vendor can serve.
** *Justification:8 Manually searching for vendors for clients is extremely laborious and repetitive. This feature
reduces the search of vendors or clients to a single line of command.
** *Highlights:* Simple single one-line command: `client#123 automatch`

=== *Major enhancement*: Profile panel
** *What it does:* Renders the profile panel in an aesthetically appealing visual format.
** *Justification:* The previous static page was not very helpful and could not be customised to contain objects such as
arrays or maps.
** *Highlights:* Built with the blazing-fast GatsbyJS React Javascript framework for static websites.
** *Note:* The code for this portion resides in a https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/profile-site[separate
repository].

=== *Minor enhancement*: Contact type serialization
** *What it does:* Serializes the contact (both clients and vendors) as different types of entities in the same XML
file.
** *Justification:* Prior to this change, there was no mechanism to differentiate between clients and vendors when the
data was de-serialized from the XML file.
** *Highlights:* Serializes both client and vendor data into the same address book XML each type with a differentiable
format.

=== *Other contributions*:
** Took initiative to ensure that we had everything prioritized in the right order and ensure the team was focused
during our discussions.
** Spearheaded the various architecture design discussions.
** Smashed a ton of bugs!
