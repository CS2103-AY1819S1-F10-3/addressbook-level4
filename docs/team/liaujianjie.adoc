== Introduction

This document serves as a summary for my contribution to the https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main[*Heart²*
project].

For more, you can visit my https://jianjie.co[personal website] to see other projects I was involved in.

== Overview

*Heart²* is a cross-platform enterprise wedding management desktop application that enables wedding agencies to easily
match clients (couples looking to have a wedding ceremony) to vendors (companies that offer services catered to
weddings).

*Some features include*:

* CLI interface and rich GUI interface
* Client and vendor database
* Detailed tabular breakdown of services listed
* Auto-matching of clients and vendors

*General metrics of my contribution* (as of 4 Nov 2018)

* ✔ 2,136 LoC changed
* ✔ 38 commits created
* ✔ 26 pull requests merged
* ✔ 19 issues raised

== Summary of contributions

=== *Major enhancement*: Auto-matching
** *What it does:* Automatically finds vendors that can fulfill the service requirements of a specific client.
Inversely, it can also find all clients for which a specific vendor can serve.
** *Justification:8 Manually searching for vendors for clients is extremely laborious and repetitive. This feature
reduces the search of vendors or clients to a single line of command.
** *Highlights:* Simple single one-line command: `client#123 automatch`

=== *Major enhancement*: Profile panel
** *What it does:* Renders the profile panel in an aesthetically appealing visual format.
** *Justification:* The previous static page was not very helpful and could not be customised to contain objects such as
arrays or maps.
** *Highlights:* Built with the blazing-fast GatsbyJS React Javascript framework for static websites.
** *Note:* The code for this portion resides in a https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/profile-site[separate
repository].

=== *Minor enhancement*: Contact type serialization
** *What it does:* Serializes the contact (both clients and vendors) as different types of entities in the same XML
file.
** *Justification:* Prior to this change, there was no mechanism to differentiate between clients and vendors when the
data was de-serialized from the XML file.
** *Highlights:* Serializes both client and vendor data into the same address book XML each type with a differentiable
format.

=== *Other contributions*:
** Took initiative to ensure that we had everything prioritized in the right order and ensure the team was focused
during our discussions.
** Spearheaded the various architecture design discussions.
** Smashed a ton of bugs!
** Refactored `ServiceProvider` to `Vendor`

== Contributions to the User Guide

end-users._

=== Modifying the global structure of user guide

Since I was involved in the modelling of our application, I took charge in making the first wave of sweeping updates to our user guide. In doing so, I created a clear separation between _entity types_ (such as `client`) and _entity instances_ (like `client#123`).

Commands acting on a collection of a specific entity type were preceded by the name of the entity type whilst commands acting on a specific entity instance are preceded by a composition of the instance entity type and identifier.

Example documentation of a command that acts on an entity type:

====
Listing and searching for clients

You can view clients in the database as a list using the `client list` command.

If you do not key in any parameters, it will list out all the clients,
otherwise it will list all clients matching all of the search parameters you provided.

Format: `client list [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]

Example documentation of a command that acts on an entity instance:

====
Deleting a contact: `delete`

You can also `delete` a contact from Heart², by specifying its unique ID.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> delete`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]

|`vendor#123 delete`

=== Documentation for auto-matching

I wrote the entire instructions for using one of the most critial feature of our application--auto-matching.

====
Automatching for a client: `automatch`

You can easily find service providers that can fulfill the requests services with this command.

[cols="^,<9a", frame=none]

Format: `client#<ID> automatch`

=== Adding icons

Additionally, I have added some coloured icons for notes, tips and warnings to provide a consistent visual format when additional content is appended.

=== Document design decisions for auto-matching

I documented the design decisions behind auto-matching and created a custom graphic to assist in the explanation. Below is an excerpt from the developer guide:

====
Finding matches between clients and service providers

The application boasts auto-matching features that reduces the (once-laborious) task of matching service providers a single command.

High level design

.High level overview of how auto-matching works
image::auto-matching.png[width:"800"]

1. On invocation, the auto-matching algorithm functionally maps all service requirements from a Client into predicates for performing the first step of filtering the Service Providers.
2. The service providers are then sorted by a fair ranking algorithm to ensure even distribution of jobs between Service Providers.
