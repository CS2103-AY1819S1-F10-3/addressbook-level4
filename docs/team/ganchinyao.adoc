This portfolio aims to provide a summary of what I have contributed as a student for the project *_Heart²_*.

== Introduction
image::abouttheproject.png[width="450"]

image::intropicture.png[width="250"]

*_Heart²_* is a desktop application for wedding planning agencies to efficiently manage their clients and service providers. It allows the agency to automatically match the agency's service providers to existing clients' needs, and also maintains a easy-to-use database search system for clients' and service providers' profiles.

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX

It is cross-platform and can be compiled for both Windows and Mac OS.

*_Heart²_* was developed on top of the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application. It consists of 5 dedicated members, including myself. My role in *_Heart²_* was a software engineer, tasked to create a `Login` feature from scratch and `Privileges` for different types of user accounts.

image::major.png[width="450"]

=== Major enhancements

Added `login` and `logout` functions, and allow users to `register` for a user account.

* *What it does:* Allow the user to register for an account, and use that account to login to the application. Afterwards, the user can logout of his/her account.
* *Justification:* Without an authorised account, the user is unable to use this application as it is mandatory to login at start. This feature is important as it restricts access to the application from unauthorised parties. Clients' and Service Providers' information are present in the application, and it is necessary to protect these information from unwanted eyes.
* *Highlights:* Storing user account information was a challenge as the project restriction only allows files to be stored locally. Nonetheless, password is stored as hashed using `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm with salt to prevent anyone from looking up the user's password directly. The implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.
* *Functional code contributed*: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/97[Register account] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/135[Login] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/LogoutCommand.java[Logout] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/173[Salt and Hash] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedAccount.java[Storage] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAccountStorage.java[Storage 2] | link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlSerializableAccountList.java[Storage 3]

image::minor.png[width="450"]

=== Minor enhancements

* *Minor enhancement:* Allow user to `edit password` as well as creating account access privilege with either `Super User` or `Read-Only User`.
* *Justification:* Edit password is needed as user may want to change his/her password from time to time, especially for compromised accounts. Allocating account privileges tied to the user account helps in preventing unnecessary modifications to the application database. For example, an employee tasked as call-support role would be allocated `Read-Only User` as he/she does not need to modify data in the application.

== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_This section shows what I have contributed to the User Guide. It showcases my ability to write documentation targetting end-user._
|===

Github link to User Guide: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc

=== Make the User Guide pretty
I created the title graphic below that is present on the first page of the User Guide to draw the reader's attention. This also makes the User Guide more aesthetically pleasing.

.The tile graphic
image::userguideimage.png[width="350"]

In addition, I have also created title headers like the one below to better differentiate each sections. This makes it easier for user to identify different segments of the User Guide.

=== Crafted an `example` format:

I crafter an example format below which was used consistently throughout the User Guide to let users easily identify an example of a real command. This allows users to copy a working command conveniently and paste it into the application to trigger the command.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|* `client#id addservice t/photography p/2000`
 * `client#id addservice t/catering p/10000`

image::quotestart.png[width="180"]


=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`login u/rootUser p/rootPassword`
|=====

=== Logging out : `logout`

Securely logs you out of the system.

Format: `logout`

=== Registering a new account : `register account`

Register a new account for this application. You can only register a new account via an account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. By default, `rootUser` is a default account with `SUPER_USER` privilege.

[NOTE]
It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

Format: `register account u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD r/ROLE`

`r/ROLE`:
either
`r/superuser`
 or `r/readonlyuser` to create a `SUPER_USER` account or `READ_ONLY_USER` account respectively.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`register account u/myNewUsername p/p@ssw0rd r/superuser`
|=====

=== Change the current password : `change password`

Change your current account password from an old password to a new password.

Condition: your old password is typed in correctly, and new password should not be the same as old password.

[CAUTION]
Make sure your new password is typed correctly. There is no confirmation prompt once you execute the command.

Format: `change password o/YOUR_OLD_PASSWORD n/YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`change password o/jf3nv n/j9y3nd`
