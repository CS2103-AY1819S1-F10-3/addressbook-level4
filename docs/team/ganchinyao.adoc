== Introduction
image::abouttheproject.png[width="450"]

image::intropicture.png[width="250"]

*_Heart²_* is a desktop application for wedding planning agencies to efficiently manage their clients and service providers. It allows the agency to automatically match the agency's service providers to existing clients' needs, and also maintains a easy-to-use database search system for clients' and service providers' profiles.

It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX

It is cross-platform and can be compiled for both Windows and Mac OS.

*_Heart²_* was developed on top of the link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application. It consists of 5 dedicated members, including myself. My role in *_Heart²_* was a software engineer, tasked to create a `Login` feature from scratch and `Privileges` for different types of user accounts.

image::major.png[width="450"]

=== Major enhancements

Added `login` and `logout` functions, and allow users to `register` for a user account.

* *What it does:* Allows the user to register for an account, and use that account to log in to the application. Afterwards, the user can log out of his/her account.
* *Justification:* Clients' and Service Providers' personal information are present in the application, and it is necessary to protect these information from unwanted eyes. Logging in to use the application is an important feature as it restricts access to the application from unauthorised parties. Without an authorised account, the user is unable to use this application as it is mandatory to login at start.
* *Highlights:* Storing user account information was a challenge as the project restriction only allows files to be stored locally. Nonetheless, password is stored as hashed using `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm with salt to prevent anyone from looking up the user's password directly. The implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.

image::minor.png[width="450"]

=== Minor enhancements

* *Minor enhancement:* Allows user to `edit password` as well as creating account access privilege with either `Super User` or `Read-Only User`.
* *Justification:* Edit password is needed as user may want to change his/her password from time to time, especially for compromised accounts. Allocating account privileges tied to the user account helps in preventing unnecessary modifications to the application database. For example, an employee tasked as call-support role would be allocated `Read-Only User` as he/she does not need to modify data in the application.

=== Overview of contributions
Below are the overviews of what I have contributed towards the User Guide.

==== Make the User Guide pretty
I created various graphic assets for the User Guide to make the User Guide more pleasing to read. Below are examples of some of the graphic assets I have created.

.Examples of graphics contributed
image::userguideexample.png[width="700"]

The left image above shows the overall title graphic that is on the first page of the User Guide, and the right image shows an example of a title header to better differentiate each sections in the User Guide. This showcases my ability to create graphic asset from scratch.


==== Crafted an `example` format:

I crafted a format which was used consistently throughout the User Guide to let users easily identify an example of a real command. This allows users to copy a working command conveniently and paste it into the application to trigger the command.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|* `client#id addservice t/photography p/2000`
 * `client#id addservice t/catering p/10000`
|=====

The above is the `example format` used consistently throughout the User Guide.

==== Wrote content for the User Guide
I have written paragraphs relating to the new commands I have added to the application to teach users how to use those commands. The exact content I have written for the User Guide is shown below in Section 3.2.

==== *_Part A_*

[Discrete]
=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`login u/rootUser p/rootPassword`
|=====

[Discrete]
=== Logging out : `logout`

Securely logs you out of the system.

Format: `logout`

[Discrete]
=== Registering a new account : `register account`

Register a new account for this application. You can only register a new account *after logging in* via an account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. By default, `rootUser` is a default account with `SUPER_USER` privilege.

[NOTE]
It may sound counter-intuitive to log in to the application before you can register a new account. We make this a requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

Format: `register account u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD r/ROLE`

`r/ROLE`:
either
`r/superuser`
 or `r/readonlyuser` to create a `SUPER_USER` account or `READ_ONLY_USER` account respectively.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`register account u/myNewUsername p/p@ssw0rd r/superuser`
|=====

[Discrete]
=== Change the current password : `change password`

Change your current account password from an old password to a new password.

Condition: your old password is typed in correctly, and new password should not be the same as old password.

[CAUTION]
Make sure your new password is typed correctly. There is no confirmation prompt once you execute the command.

Format: `change password o/YOUR_OLD_PASSWORD n/YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`change password o/jf3nv n/j9y3nd`

==== 4.2.2. *_Part B_*

[Discrete]
=== Account creation
Account is created for the purpose of logging in and authenticating the user, before the user is allowed to use the application. This protects the confidentiality and data integrity of the application.

[NOTE]
User can only register for an account via an existing account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

==== Types of account
There are 2 types of account:

* `SUPER_USER` : A user that is capable of executing all commands available in the application.
* `READ_ONLY_USER` : A user that is capable of executing all commands except registering new account, adding, editing, and deleting entries in the database.

These 2 types of accounts are referred as Role and facilitated by the `Role` enum.

The restrictions of a `READ_ONLY_USER` is enforced by the methods found in `Account` class, specifically:

* `boolean hasWritePrivilege()`
* `boolean hasDeletePrivilege()`
* `boolean hasAccountCreationPrivilege()`

Commands that prevents a `READ_ONLY_USER` from executing is checked with a condition as such:

[source,java]
if (!account.hasWritePrivilege()) {
    throw new LackOfPrivilegeException(COMMAND_WORD);
}


[Discrete]
=== Account storage
All accounts are stored in a file call `/data/accountlist.xml`. This file is generated on the fly during first launch and populated with a root account. By default, a root account is hardcoded into the application with the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword` with the role `SUPER_USER`.

The diagram below shows what happen when a user launches the application:

.Activity diagram when user launches the application
image::accountstoragediagram.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

Only a `SUPER_USER` is allowed to create a new account, either for himself, or on behalf of another person. The diagram below shows what happen when a user attempts to register a new account:

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: What file type to store user account as?
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Store it as a `xml` file locally.
** Pros: The code to write and read xml file is already present for adding address book contact initially in the Address Book - level 4 app. Hence, adopting this code and modifying it for account storage is easier than coming up with code from scratch.
** Cons: Relatively wordy and verbose with all the opening and closing tag. For the same amount of account information, compared to other format such as `json`, more data has to be stored to account for tag elements.
* *Alternative 2:* Store it as a `json` file locally.
** Pros: Simpler syntax than `xml` and hence less data is required to store the same amount of account information.
** Pros: Can be parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
** Cons: Not familiar with json, hence more effort is needed to write code to store account in json format, compared to the already given code for xml storage.

==== Security Considerations

===== Database
Currently, the list of accounts is stored locally on data/accountlist.xml. For security purposes, we may consider the following implementations in the future for v2.0:

* **Encrypt accountlist.xml:** This can prevent direct lookup of the file as the content is encrypted
* **Store the file on a server:** Due to project restriction, we are unable to implement this at v1.4. Storing file on a server has an added advantage of utilising web security practises or employing third party services to help protect our account list in private servers.

===== Storing password
Username is stored in plaintext in accountlist.xml, as username is not private information. However, user password is hashed with `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` algorithm together with a `salt`, to prevent password from being visible in plaintext. `PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512` is deliberately chosen as it is a link:https://adambard.com/blog/3-wrong-ways-to-store-a-password/[slower] algorithm, thus slowing down brute-force attack for finding out user password. The hashing algorithm is present in `PasswordAuthentication` class and the implementation is based off this link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/2861125/3474[stackoverflow] answer.
