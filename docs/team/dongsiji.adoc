= PROJECT: Heart²

The purpose of this document is to document the contribution that I have made in the project: *_Heart²_*
as a student undertaking the module CS2103T under NUS School of Computing.

---

== Introduction

*_Heart²_* is a desktop software aiming to make the job of wedding planning agencies simpler.
It provides simple yet powerful features to efficiently manage clients' and agency companies' profiles.
Users can find suitable wedding service providers for clients using just a few keystrokes with our enterprise featureset.

The project is written in Java and has about 10 thousand lines of code. The user interacts with the application mainly using a Command Line Interface (CLI),
and it also has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX for users who are not so adept with the keyboard.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|Below is a summary of the contributions that I have made to the project.
|===

=== Major Enhancement
* *Major enhancement*: Revamp the `list` command.
* *Functionality*: The user is able to use the `list` command to list all clients or vendors. They are also able to use the command to search through clients and vendors by providing the relevant keywords that they want to search for.
* *Justification*: By having both the searching and listing functionality in one command the user will have less commands to familiarise with and it increases the ease of use of the application.
* *Highlights*: To revamp the list command, I need to have a deep understanding of how the commands work as well as how the parser works, which I spent time to familiarise myself with. I also had to change how some of the information was stored in the application, so that the relevant information could be retrieved easily when needed.

* *Test Code Contributed*: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/150[all tests]

=== Minor Enhancement
* *Minor enhancement*: Enhance `undo` and `redo` commands to display the list which was modified.
* *Functionality*: The list shown to the user after executing the `undo` and `redo` commands will be the list of clients or vendors that was changed through the command.
* *Justification*: This is to allow the user to be able to see what was changed at a glance without needing to navigate to the corresponding list.
* *Functional Code Contributed*: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/188[all code]
* *Test Code Contributed*: link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-F10-3/main/pull/188[all tests]

=== Listing and searching for contacts: `list`

You can view all the contact of a specific type in a list by specifying the contact type to be shown.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> list`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list`
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list`
|=====

*_Heart²_* also supports searching via name, phone number, email, address and tags for you to quickly find your contacts.
To search, simply append your search parameters to the back of the original command.

Only contacts that matches all the search parameters will be displayed to you in the form of a list.
Searching is done through substring matching, so you do not need to enter the full name, just part of the name will do.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> list [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list n/John`
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list p/98765432`
|=====

=== Undo the previous command: `undo`

Undo the commands that you have entered in chronological order for this particular session. Once you logout or exit the application, you cannot `undo` a command from the last session.

Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
The application will only undo commands that modifies the list of contacts: `add`, `update`, `delete`, `clear`

[NOTE]
The application will show either the client list or vendor list corresponding to the command that was undone.

=== Redo the commands undone: `redo`

Redo the commands that you have undone by undo in chronological order for this particular session. Once you logout or exit the application, you cannot `redo` a command from the last session.

Format: `redo`

[NOTE]
Commands that have been undone will be reset upon a `clear` command.

[NOTE]
The application will show either the client list or vendor list corresponding to the command that was redone.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

|===
|Below are sections I contributed to the Developer Guide. They showcase my ability to write technical documentation and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.

=== List Feature
*_Heart²_* allows you view all the clients or the vendors with a simple command: `list`.

When listing contacts, you would have to specify whether the contact is a client or a vendor
by prefixing it to list:

* `client list`
* `vendor list`

Below shows an example of how listing all clients works:

{empty} +

Furthermore, you are also able to add keywords after the list to do filtering, and each keyword is specified to
belong to a category and only contacts which contains all of the keywords in their respective categories will be shown.

[NOTE]
====
Categories include:

* `n/ NAME`
* `p/ PHONE_NUMBER`
* `e/ EMAIL_ADDRESS`
* `a/ ADDRESS`
* `t/ TAGS`
====

Below shows an example of how list filtering works:

._The UI showing list filtering._
image::ListClientsWithKeywords.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

==== Implementation

The keywords from the command to be used for filtering is parsed by the `ListCommandParser` into a `ContactInformation`
and passed to a `Predicate` to be used for filtering. The `Predicate` is implemented as `ContactContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Below is a sequence diagram showing the creation of the `ListCommand`.

._The Sequence Diagram of the creation of a list command._
image::ListSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]

{empty} +

We use a `FilteredList` and pass the combination of 2 `Predicates` into it, one to filter the type of contact,
clients or vendors and the other is to filter by keywords, which is the `ContactContainsKeywordsPredicate` from the `ListCommandParser`.

Below is a sequence diagram showing the execution of the `ListCommand`.

==== Design considerations

[none]
==== Aspect 1: Substring Matching or Word Matching
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Substring matching.
** Pros: Users would be able to view a wider range of results that matches the substring they have given. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results might not be filtered away if they contain the substring.
* *Alternative 2:* Word matching.
** Pros: Guarantees that no irrelevant results are shown.
** Cons: Relevant results that have a small difference in the wording will be filtered away and not shown.

[none]
==== Aspect 2: Categorised or Non-categorised keywords
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Categorised keywords.
** Pros: Users are able to specify which keywords they want to search for in which category.
Gives better control over the searching.
** Cons: Users have to follow a specific format to type the keywords.
* *Alternative 2:* Non-categorised keywords.
** Pros: User can type in the keywords in any order they want. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results that contains the keywords will be shown.

[none]
==== Aspect 3: All Match or Any Match
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* All match.
** Pros: Users can specify what they want to search for and filter out all irrelevant results.
** Cons: Users are not able to search for multiple things, when they only require one of them to match.
* *Alternative 2:* Any match.
** Pros: Users are able to obtain a wider search result. Easier to use.
** Cons: Irrelevant results that contains only one or a few keywords will be shown as well.
