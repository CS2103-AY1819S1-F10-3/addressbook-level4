== Features
The following format is consistent for all the commands listed in this section.

image::format.png[width="256"]

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. E.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

image::commands.png[width="256"]
The following section documents all the commands available in this application.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens a new window that contains the user guide to help you find out any information you need.

Format: `help`

=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`login u/rootUser p/rootPassword`
|=====

=== Logging out : `logout`

Securely logs you out of the system.

Format: `logout`

=== Registering a new account : `register account`

Register a new account for this application. You can only register a new account via an account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. By default, `rootUser` is a default account with `SUPER_USER` privilege.

[NOTE]
It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

Format: `register account u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD r/ROLE`

`r/ROLE`:
either
`r/superuser`
 or `r/readonlyuser` to create a `SUPER_USER` account or `READ_ONLY_USER` account respectively.

=== Change the current password : `change password`
