The following format is consistent for all the commands listed in this section.

image::format.png[width="256"]

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. E.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `<CONTACT_TYPE>` is to replaced with either `client` OR `vendor`
* `<ID>` is to replaced with a valid ID

Heart² is designed with an intuitive command syntax for your ease of use.
The following section documents all the commands available for you in this application.

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens a new window that contains the user guide to help you find out any information you need.

Format: `help`

=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`login u/rootUser p/rootPassword`
|=====

=== Logging out : `logout`

Securely logs you out of the system.

Format: `logout`

=== Registering a new account : `register account`

Register a new account for this application. You can only register a new account via an account with `SUPER_USER` privilege. By default, `rootUser` is a default account with `SUPER_USER` privilege.

[NOTE]
It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.

Format: `register account u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD r/ROLE`

`r/ROLE`:
either
`r/superuser`
 or `r/readonlyuser` to create a `SUPER_USER` account or `READ_ONLY_USER` account respectively.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`register account u/myNewUsername p/p@ssw0rd r/superuser`
|=====

=== Change the current password : `change password`

Change your current account password from an old password to a new password.

Condition: your old password is typed in correctly, and new password should not be the same as old password.

[CAUTION]
Make sure your new password is typed correctly. There is no confirmation prompt once you execute the command.

Format: `change password o/YOUR_OLD_PASSWORD n/YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`change password o/jf3nv n/j9y3nd`
|=====

=== Working with contacts

There are two types of contacts supported by Heart², namely `client` and `vendor`.

TIP: All commands pertaining to contacts start with either `client` or `vendor`.

==== Adding a contact

You can `add` a contact together with its particulars into Heart² by specifying its contact type first, that is, `client` or `vendor`.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> add n/FULL_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS a/HOME_ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client add n/John Doe p/87654321 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/123 Lorem Street, #45-67, Singapore 890123`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor add n/Mary Jane p/98765432 e/maryjane@gmail.com a/123 Lorem Street, #67-89, Singapore 890321`
|=====

// tag::listClient[]
==== Listing and searching for contacts

You can also `list` your different contacts by specifying the contact type to be shown.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list`
|=====

Heart² also supports searching via name, phone number, email, address and tags for you to quickly find your contacts.
To search, simply append your search parameters to the back of the original command.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> list [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list n/John`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list p/98765432`
|=====
// end::listClient[]

=== Manipulating a specific contact

Contacts in Heart² are assigned a unique ID each for you to refer back to them.
This unique ID allows you to refer the contact at any point of time when using Heart².

[TIP]
Commands pertaining to one specific contact have an additional unique ID appended to the back of `client` or `vendor`

[TIP]
These IDs are persistent for one session. Each restart of Heart reassigns IDs to contacts, effectively compacting the IDs of your contacts.

[NOTE]
IDs can be similar for `client` and `vendor`.
However, since the contact type and ID comes together, they would still refer to different contacts!

==== Viewing a contact

You can `view` detailed information about a specific contact using its unique ID.
This information will be displayed on the right panel in Heart².

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> select`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]

|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]

You can also `update` a contact's particulars, again by specifying its unique ID, followed by the updated fields.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> update [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`
