== Features

The following format is consistent for all the commands listed in this section.

image::format.png[width="256"]

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. E.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* `<CONTACT_TYPE>` is to replaced with either `client` OR `vendor`
* `<ID>` is to replaced with a valid ID, and only integers are recognised as an ID.

* Example: An `example table` shows the source code format for a particular command

image::callouts2.png[width="256"]

Callouts are a rectangular box with icon and words to point out some information. Below are the 3 callouts that will be used consistently throughout this document:

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|This represents a *note*. A note is information that is important, but may not be applicable to you. Be sure to read a note and see if it is applicable to you.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-tips.png[width="48", role="center"]
|This represents a *tip*. A tip is something that is often handy, and good for you to know. Tip is often not crucial, and you can choose to skip them.
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-danger.png[width="48", role="center"]
|This represents a *warning*. You should be extremely cautious and read the warning statement carefully.

image::commands.png[width="256"]

Heart² is designed with an intuitive command syntax for your ease of use.
The following section documents all the commands available for you in this application.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|Only `help`, `login`, and `exit` commands are available prior to logging in. The rest of the commands are only available after logging in the the application.
|=====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Opens a new window that contains the user guide to help you find out any information you need.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]

|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|You cannot `undo` a help.
|=====

Format: `help`

=== Logging in : `login`

Securely logs you in to access the system. By default, a root account with `SUPER_USER` privilege is provided, using the username `rootUser` and password `rootPassword`.

Condition: You must not already been logged in. Otherwise, it will be an unknown command.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|You cannot `undo` a login.
|=====

Format: `login u/USERNAME p/PASSWORD`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|It may sound counter-intuitive to require an account before registering a new account. We make this requirement as only authorised personal should be given an account. Ideally, the owner of the application should dictate the account given to employees by helping them register an account.
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|You cannot `undo` registering a new account.

|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`register account u/myNewUsername p/p@ssw0rd r/superuser`
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-danger.png[width="48", role="center"]
|Make sure your password is typed correctly. There is no confirmation prompt once you execute the command.
|=====

=== Change the current password : `change password`

|=====

=== Working with contacts

There are two types of contacts supported by Heart², namely `client` and `vendor`.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-tips.png[width="48", role="center"]
|All commands pertaining to contacts start with either `client` or `vendor`.
|=====

==== Adding a contact: `add`

You can `add` a contact together with its particulars into Heart² by specifying its contact type first, that is, `client` or `vendor`.

Condition: You cannot add a contact that already exists in the application. Two contacts are considered equal if they are the same type (either both clients or both vendors), possess the same name, and either the same phone number or the same email address.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> add n/FULL_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS a/HOME_ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client add n/John Doe p/87654321 e/johndoe@gmail.com a/123 Lorem Street, #45-67, Singapore 890123`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor add n/Mary Jane p/98765432 e/maryjane@gmail.com a/123 Lorem Street, #67-89, Singapore 890321`
|=====

// tag::listClient[]
==== Listing and searching for contacts: `list`

You can also `list` your different contacts by specifying the contact type to be shown.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list`
|=====

Heart² also supports searching via name, phone number, email, address and tags for you to quickly find your contacts.
To search, simply append your search parameters to the back of the original command.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE> list [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client list n/John`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor list p/98765432`
|=====
// end::listClient[]

=== Manipulating a specific contact

Contacts in Heart² are assigned a unique ID each for you to refer to the contact at any point of time when using Heart².


[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-tips.png[width="48", role="center"]
|Commands pertaining to one specific contact have an additional unique ID appended to the back of `client` or `vendor`
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-tips.png[width="48", role="center"]
|These IDs are persistent for one session. Each restart of Heart reassigns IDs to contacts, effectively compacting the IDs of your contacts.
|=====

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:icon-notes.png[width="48", role="center"]
|IDs can be similar for `client` and `vendor`. However, since the contact type and ID comes together, they would still refer to different contacts!
|=====

==== Viewing a contact: `view`

You can `view` detailed information about a specific contact using its unique ID.
This information will be displayed on the right panel in Heart².

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> view`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#3 view`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#3 view`
|=====

==== Deleting a contact: `delete`

You can also `delete` a contact from Heart², by specifying its unique ID.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> delete`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#123 delete`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#123 delete`
|=====

==== Updating a contact: `update`

You can also `update` a contact's particulars, again by specifying its unique ID, followed by the updated fields.

Condition: You cannot update a contact to make the contact equals to another contact that already exists in the application. Two contacts are considered equal if they are the same type (either both clients or both vendors), possess the same name, and either the same phone number or the same email address.

Format: `<CONTACT_TYPE>#<ID> update [n/FULL_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL_ADDRESS] [a/HOME_ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`client#123 update n/Jane Doe e/janedoe@gmail.com`
|=====
[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
|image:exampleimage.png[width="64", role="center"]
|`vendor#123 update n/Bob Vans e/bobvans@gmail.com`
|=====

// tag::addservice[]
==== Adding a service: `addservice`

Attributes of the services your clients require or vendors can provide can be indicated using the
 `addservice` command, by their unique IDs.

[cols="^,<5a", frame=none]
|=====
